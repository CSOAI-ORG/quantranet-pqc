# QuantraNet PQC MCP Server - Quick Start Guide

## 30-Second Overview

QuantraNet is a Model Context Protocol server that provides expert-level post-quantum cryptography assessment through 6 powerful tools:

1. **PQC Readiness Assessment** - Evaluates your quantum security posture
2. **Crypto Audit** - Identifies vulnerable algorithms
3. **Migration Planning** - Creates a phased PQC transition roadmap
4. **Threat Modeling** - Assesses "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" risks
5. **Compliance Checking** - Verifies regulatory alignment (NIST, White House, CNSA, EU)
6. **Algorithm Recommendation** - Suggests NIST-approved PQC algorithms

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Financial Services (10 minutes)
```
1. Use PQC Assessment → Readiness score: 35 (HIGH RISK)
2. Run Crypto Audit → RSA/ECDSA vulnerable
3. Create Migration Plan → 24-month timeline
4. Check Compliance → Non-compliant with White House mandate
5. Get Recommendations → Deploy ML-KEM/ML-DSA hybrid
```

### Example 2: Healthcare Provider (8 minutes)
```
1. Threat Model → HNDL risk CRITICAL for health records
2. Compliance Check → HIPAA + NIST requirements
3. Algorithm Recommend → PQC for patient data encryption
4. Migration Plan → Phased approach, maintain compatibility
```

### Example 3: Government Agency (6 minutes)
```
1. Compliance Check → CNSA 2.0 mandatory (2028 deadline)
2. PQC Assessment → Accelerated timeline required
3. Migration Plan → NSA-approved algorithms only
4. Threat Model → State-level threat assessment
```

## Common Questions Answered

**Q: When do we need to migrate to PQC?**
A: Immediately for new systems; 2025-2028 for existing infrastructure; deadline is 2030 for US federal agencies.

**Q: Will PQC break our existing systems?**
A: Not if done correctly. Use hybrid approach (classical + PQC in parallel) during transition.

**Q: How much will this cost?**
A: USD 150K-400K (small), USD 500K-2.5M (medium), USD 2.5M-40M+ (enterprise).

**Q: Are PQC algorithms proven?**
A: Yes - NIST standardized them after 8-year evaluation process (FIPS 203-206).

**Q: Which algorithms should we use?**
A: Primary: ML-KEM (key exchange), ML-DSA (signatures). See tool for recommendations.

**Q: What about performance impact?**
A: Minimal - PQC is fast: ~100μs key generation, ~400μs signing, similar to classical.

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need 18+)
node --version

# Check dependencies installed
npm install

# Check build succeeded
npm run build

# Try with verbose output
NODE_DEBUG=* npm run dev
```

### Tool returns error
- Check input format matches examples in EXAMPLES.md
- Verify all required fields are present
- Review error message from Zod validation

### Results seem incorrect
- Verify your algorithm names match NIST standards (RSA-2048, not RSA-2k)
- Check data sensitivity level (low/medium/high/critical)
- Confirm sector is valid (finance, healthcare, defense, etc.)
